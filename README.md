I am a PhD student at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). I also work as a research assistant on the ERC-funded [GRIEVANCE project](https://www.grievance-erc.com/). The focus of my research is understanding threats of violence by using computational linguistics. I aim to develop solutions to better understand and counter radicalisation, extremism, terrorism, and other forms of grievance-fuelled targeted violence. I am also interested in improving research transparency within and beyond the field of crime science: check out the [open science seminar series](jdiopen.github.io) I co-organise.

### Recent activities
- I presented at the 2019 [POLTEXT](https://www.poltextconference.org/) conference, on 14-15 September in Tokyo, Japan. The talk discussed the working paper: 'Online influence, offline violence: Linguistic responses to the 'Unite the Right' rally (with Maximilian Mozes, Bennett Kleinberg, Paul Gill).
- I was a guest tweeter for [Researc/hers code](https://twitter.com/ResearcHersCode) a platform supporting women in computational science, research and tech. 
- I spoke at the [Society for Terrorism Research conference](https://www.societyforterrorismresearch.org/international-conference-2019) in Oslo, 20-21 June 2019. My talk focussed on developing the GRIEVANCE dictionary: understanding terrorist language use (with Bennett Kleinberg, Paul Gill). I also co-presented the paper: Towards Open and Reproducible Terrorism Studies (with Sandy Schumann, Bart Schuurman, & Paul Gill). 
- At the 2019 UCL Open Science Day, we spoke about our open science seminar series at the Department of Security and Crime Science. You can find the website for JDI Open [here](jdiopen.github.io) and our slides on 'Promoting Open (Crime) Science' [here](https://jdiopen.github.io/jdiopen.github.io/osday.pdf).
