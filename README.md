I am a PhD student at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). I also work as a research assistant on the ERC-funded [GRIEVANCE project](https://www.grievance-erc.com/). The focus of my research is understanding threats of violence by using computational linguistics. I aim to develop solutions to better understand and counter radicalisation, extremism, terrorism, and other forms of grievance-fuelled targeted violence. I am also interested in improving research transparency within and beyond the field of crime science: check out the [open science seminar series](jdiopen.github.io) I co-organise.

### Recent activities
- For International Women in Engineering Day 2020, the UCL Engineering faculty interviewed me in this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSfAuZAeALM) about my work, how the Covid-19 situation has impacted this, and what advice I'd give to a young person wanting to enter the field of STEM. 
- I presented at the 2019 [POLTEXT](https://www.poltextconference.org/) conference, on 14-15 September in Tokyo, Japan. The talk discussed the working paper: 'Online influence, offline violence: Linguistic responses to the 'Unite the Right' rally (with Maximilian Mozes, Bennett Kleinberg, Paul Gill).
- I was a guest tweeter for [Researc/hers code](https://twitter.com/ResearcHersCode) a platform supporting women in computational science, research and tech.
