I am a PhD student at the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). I also work as a research assistant on the ERC-funded [GRIEVANCE project](https://www.grievance-erc.com/). The focus of my research is understanding and predicting threats of violence by using computational linguistics. I currently work on projects examining language use in lone actor terrorist manifestos, extremist forums, and threats to public figures.

### News (Fall 2018)
- Together with [JDI Open](https://jdiopen.github.io/) and the [GRIEVANCE project](https://www.grievance-erc.com/) we are running a survey on open science & terrorism studies. If you are a terrorism researcher, please consider participating [here](https://www.soscisurvey.de/openscience_terrorismstudies/).
- I am co-organising a workshop on linguistic temporal trajectory analyis at the European Computational Social Science symposium 2018. You can find more information and register [here](http://symposium.computationalsocialscience.eu/2018/#call)!
- Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09722) on sentiment trajectories of YouTube vlogs will be presented at [EMNLP 2018](http://emnlp2018.org/) in Brussels.
