I am an assistant professor with the [Utrecht University department of Sociology](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/sociology). The focus of my research is understanding (online) extremism and threats of violence by using computational linguistics. I hold a PhD from the [UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). I aim to develop solutions to better understand and counter radicalisation, extremism, terrorism, and other forms of grievance-fuelled targeted violence. I am also interested in improving research transparency within and beyond the field of crime science.
